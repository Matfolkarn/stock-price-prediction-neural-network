Fun experiment! This program was developed for the Linc Hackathon 2024, featuring a neural network model called N-Beats, inspired by "Element AI." The N-Beats model performed exceptionally well in the Makridakis M-competition, which led me to create this program to test its effectiveness in predicting stock price data.
